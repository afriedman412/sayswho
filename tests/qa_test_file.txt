Terrance Mannery was helping customers and cleaning up the Doki Doki dessert shop just before closing Saturday night when four frightened, breathless men burst through the door.
They had just left the Utah Pride Festival, they said, when at least a dozen young, white men began following and harassing them.
Mannery looked at the entrance of Doki Doki. Men were crowding around the window, making taunting gestures. One opened the door to the entryway vestibule.
“Based on the actions the group was making, based on everything the gentlemen who came in had told me — if I allowed anyone in the store, they would try to cause harm to people,” he said. “I couldn’t see how big the group was. I thought, ’It’s just seven to 10 people. Maybe they’ll back off.’”
Witnesses outside the shop said the mob was bigger than that.
Michelle Turpin, who was walking west near Doki Doki with friends after Pride, put the crowd closer to “20-ish.”
“They were all late teens, early 20s, clean-cut, typical blondie, blue-eyed, wholesome Utah boys,” she noted.
Jen Parsons-Soren, who had attended Pride with Turpin, said she heard the group yelling homophobic slurs; Salt Lake City police also have said the group was shouting slurs.
In a nearby parking lot, Lyft driver Ross Rogers was about to hit “cancel” on some late passengers at Doki Doki when he noticed a small group running into the shop, followed by a crowd of at least 15 “strong, muscular” men swarming the entrance.
“Then this African-American guy came from the restaurant,” Rogers added.
That was Mannery. Rogers watched as Mannery held out his arms, trying to “get some distance,” when one of the attackers shoved him into the door hard enough to break the hinge. Then the man punched Mannery.
