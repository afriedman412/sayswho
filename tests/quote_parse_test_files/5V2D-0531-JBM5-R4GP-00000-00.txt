An enraged Staten Island motorist chased down a hit-and-driver who sideswiped his car and beat him with a metal bat, police said Wednesday.
Police sources said the 22-year-old victim hit the man's car Dec. 12 at 6:40 p.m. and drove off, stopping at the deli where he works, on Castleton Ave. at Sharpe Ave. in Port Richmond.
The man (photo) followed the driver, and a surveillance photo shows him inside the deli, with a bat in his hand.
The two argued outside, and the angry motorist beat the deli worker on his arms and body and then fled, cops said.
Medics took the deli worker to Richmond University Medical center with bruising and swelling. Cops are now looking for the assailant.
According to sources, the victim could face charges of leaving the scene of an accident - if his assailant shows up to file a complaint and report the crash.
The deli worker declined to comment Wednesday.
Police describe the attacker as black, in his late 20s, wearing a black skullcap, a black Nike Air sweatshirt, a black jacket and black pants.
Cops ask anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
