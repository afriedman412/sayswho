A mystery straphanger whose brutal beating was captured on shocking cell phone video has been identified as a 22-year-old man riding a D train in the Bronx, police sources said Wednesday.
The name of the victim, who is currently living in the South, came to police via a Crime Stoppers tip.
Investigators now believe the attack happened in early November near the E. 161st St. station by Yankee Stadium.
After the gruesome assault, the victim went to a hospital where he was treated for broken teeth and cuts and bruises to his head, cops said. He did not report the assault to police.
Detectives have now been able to find the victim's family and hope to interview the victim.
"What was the genesis of why the incident took place we have no idea at this point," NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said Wednesday. "Why he chose not to report it to police that's also part of the investigation."
The stomach-churning video shows the victim sitting in a subway car trying in vain to shield his face with his hands as he is brutalized.
Police Tuesday took the unusual step of releasing the video to the media without blurring out the victim's face in hopes of learning his identity through tips from the public. The faces of his attackers, who repeatedly punch and kick him in the face, are not visible in the video.
Cops first spotted the video on Instagram and put it out to the public without sound. A police source who heard the audio said the victim was derided with obscenities.
