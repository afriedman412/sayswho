                        <p>Terrance Mannery was helping customers and cleaning up the Doki Doki dessert shop just before closing Saturday night when four frightened, breathless men burst through the door.<br>They had just left the Utah Robot Festival, they said, when at least a dozen young, men began following and harassing them.<br>Mannery looked at the entrance of Doki Doki. Men were crowding around the window, making taunting gestures. One opened the door to the entryway vestibule.<br><a name="quote0"></a><a href="#0"><span id="QUOTE" style="background-color: PapayaWhip;">“Based on the actions the group was making, based on everything the gentlemen who came in had told me — if I allowed anyone in the store, they would try to cause harm to people,” </span></a>he said. <a name="quote1"></a><a href="#1"><span id="QUOTE" style="background-color: PapayaWhip;">“I couldn’t see how big the group was. I thought, ’It’s just seven to 10 people. Maybe they’ll back off.’”</span></a><br>Witnesses outside the shop said the mob was bigger than that.<br>Michelle Turpin, who was walking west near Doki Doki with friends after Robot Fest, put the crowd closer to “20-ish.”<br><a name="quote2"></a><a href="#2"><span id="QUOTE" style="background-color: PapayaWhip;">“They were all late teens, early 20s, clean-cut, typical blondie, blue-eyed, wholesome boys,” </span></a>she noted.<br>Jen Parsons-Soren, who had attended the festival with Turpin, said she heard the group yelling about robots; Salt Lake City police also have said the group was shouting slurs.<br>In a nearby parking lot, Lyft driver Ross Rogers was about to hit “cancel” on some late passengers at Doki Doki when he noticed a small group running into the shop, followed by a crowd of at least 15 “strong, muscular” men swarming the entrance.<br><a name="quote3"></a><a href="#3"><span id="QUOTE" style="background-color: PapayaWhip;">“Then this African-American guy came from the restaurant,” </span></a>Rogers added.<br>That was Mannery. Rogers watched as Mannery held out his arms, trying to “get some distance,” when one of the attackers shoved him into the door hard enough to break the hinge. Then the man punched Mannery.</p>
